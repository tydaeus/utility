<h2>
    Index Page
</h2>
<p>
    This page should provide the entry point into the application, using any javascript that is required for
    this entry point.
</p>
<p>
    By convention, the starting page for an application is named <code>index.html</code>. In a javascript
    application, the entry point into the code is named <code>main.js</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Within angular routing, the starting page for the Angular SPA is generally located at the
    <code>'/'</code> (root) path.
