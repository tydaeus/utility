# JS-Build-Template

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to provide a simple starting point for a SPA-style
javascript application using AngularJS and Bootstrap CSS, with pre-configured 
grunt build.

As much as possible, this template is designed to be backend-agnostic - in 
theory, any server or other other application container (e.g. electron) should
be able to use it.
