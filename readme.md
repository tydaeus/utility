# Utility

This project is for maintaining general purpose utility code for my own use, reuse, and documentation purposes. Most of the contained code is the sort of stuff that I've had to implement (or seen the use for) multiple times on multiple projects, but is also simple enough that I wouldn't want to bother with downloading and installing a full library, or which I want access to as a reference for implementation of common solutions.

Some utility code I would like to implement or at least document standard library utilization of in each language I encounter:

* process commandline arguments
* provide a simple menu-driven commandline interface
* provide a simple command shell
* copy a file tree
* delete a file tree
* compare file trees
* read a file line-by-line
* write to a text file
* display a console-based progress indicator
