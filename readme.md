# Utility

This project is for maintaining general purpose utility code for my own use and reuse. Most of the contained code is the sort of stuff that I've had to implement (or seen the use for) multiple times on multiple projects, but is also simple enough that I wouldn't want to bother with downloading and installing a full library.

 Others are welcome to use it at their own peril, with attribution as per the terms of the creative commons 4.0 attribution license.
